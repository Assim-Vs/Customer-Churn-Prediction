# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) based on their behaviour and usage patterns.

This project includes:

- A **trained ML model** (Random Forest)
- A **Streamlit web app** for interactive predictions
- A **Jupyter notebook** for data preprocessing and model training

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Machine Learning

- Uses **Random Forest Classifier** for churn prediction  
- Handles:
  - Missing values (imputation)
  - Feature scaling (standardization)
- Uses **numeric features only** for stable and simple training:
  - `Age`
  - `Tenure`
  - `Usage Frequency`
  - `Support Calls`
  - `Payment Delay`
  - `Total Spend`
  - `Last Interaction`
- Evaluates model using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)

### 💻 Streamlit Web App

The app provides a clean UI where you can:

- Manually enter customer details
- Click **“Predict Churn”** to:
  - See if the customer is likely to churn or not
  - View the **churn probability** as a percentage
  - See a small progress bar visualization
- View **prediction history** stored in `prediction_history.csv`

Sidebar shows:

- Test accuracy of the model  
- Confusion matrix  
- Classification report

🌐 6. How to Run the Streamlit App
Once dependencies are installed and churn_model.pkl exists:
Make sure you are in project root:

cd "Customer-Churn-Prediction"

Run the app:

streamlit run app/app.py

Streamlit will show something like:
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://192.168.x.x:8501
Open the Local URL in your browser.
